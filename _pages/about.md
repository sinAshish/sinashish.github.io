I am currently an ML Resident at [AMII](https://www.amii.ca) in the Advanced Technology team.

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning, with applications in healthcare and scientific discovery. I am particularly interested in leveraging representation learning, generative modeling, and geometric deep learning to develop robust and interpretable AI systems dedicated to transforming healthcare, particularly in precision medicine and drug discovery.

I hold an MSc ([thesis](https://summit.sfu.ca/item/38512)) in Computer Science from [Simon Fraser University](https://sfu.ca), where I worked with [Prof. Ghassan Hamarneh](https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/about/ghassans-bio), and a Bachelor’s in Materials Science from [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/). 

Previously, I was an ML Researcher at [Huawei’s Noah’s Ark Lab](https://dev3.noahlab.com.hk), a Risk Analyst at [Wells Fargo](https://wellsfargo.com/), a Research Engineer at [Preferred Networks](https://preferred.jp/en/), and an intern with [Prof. Jonghyun Choi](https://ppolon.github.io) and [Prof. Jose Dolz](https://josedolz.github.io).

If you are interested in my work, have opportunities, or would like to collaborate, please feel free to [reach out](mailto:ashishsinha108@gmail.com).
