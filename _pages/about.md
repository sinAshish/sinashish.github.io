<!-- I am currently a Machine Learning Researcher at [Huawei’s Noah’s Ark Lab](https://dev3.noahlab.com.hk) in the Embodied AI team. -->

I am currently an ML Resident at [AMII](https://www.amii.ca) in the Advanced Technology team.

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning, especially it's application in solving meaningul problems in healthcare and life sciences.
I am interested in building intelligent and interpretable systems that assist humans in their daily lives.

If you are interested in discussing these research topics, please feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:ashishsinha108@gmail.com).

I hold an MSc ([thesis](https://summit.sfu.ca/item/38512)) in Computer Science from [Simon Fraser University](https://sfu.ca), where I worked with [Prof. Ghassan Hamarneh](https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/about/ghassans-bio) and a Bachelor’s in Materials Science from [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IITR)](https://www.iitr.ac.in/). In the past, I've worked as -- an ML Researcher at [Huawei’s Noah’s Ark Lab](https://dev3.noahlab.com.hk), a Risk Analyst at [Wells Fargo](https://wellsfargo.com/), a Research Engineer at [Preferred Networks](https://preferred.jp/en/) in the Bio Team, and a Research Intern with [Prof. Jonghyun Choi](https://ppolon.github.io) and [Prof. Jose Dolz](https://josedolz.github.io).

Apart from research, I enjoy [reading](https://goodreads.com/sinashish), watching [movies/anime](https://letterboxd.com/sinashish/), [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/98067428), eating/cooking, [travelling/photography](https://instagram.com/_a.sinha_), and playing [ultimate](https://vul.ca). I do everything in moderation, except for watching movies and reading.
